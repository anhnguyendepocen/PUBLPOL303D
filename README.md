# PUBLPOL 303D
This repository contains all teaching material prepared for Stanford's PUBLPOL 303D Applied Econometrics for Public Policy.

# Course description
This course aims to present the theory and practice of empirical research in economics with particular emphasis on topics relating to public policy questions. We will start with the analysis of randomized experiments, then move to basic regression analysis and introduce the statistical software STATA. The course will put a substantial amount of effort on work with STATA in analyzing actual data sets, reproducing and criticizing results in scientific research and learning the actual practice of econometrics. We will focus on the identification of causal effects and the various econometric techniques available to learn about causality. While this is primarily a methodology module, most examples and applications will be drawn from the area of public policy. The final will be a 3-5 hour take-home exam. Prerequisite: Econ 102A.
